Leave for Pregnancy Disability and Child Bonding:
Quick Reference Guide
California law guarantees job-protected leave to eligible employees who are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition (referred to as Pregnancy Disability Leave or PDL), and separately guarantees job-protected leave to eligible employees to bond with a new child (via birth, adoption, or foster care placement) (referred to as California Family Rights Act leave or CFRA leave). Employees also have federal rights to leave for a pregnancy-related disability or to bond with a new child, which are provided for by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). When both state and federal laws apply, the employee receives the benefit of the more protective law.

CFRA and FMLA leave are also available to an employee to care for their own serious health condition or a family member with a serious health condition. For information about these forms of leave, visit Family Care and Medical Leave: Quick Reference Guide.
