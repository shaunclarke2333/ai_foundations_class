**document1.txt** (About ChromaDB):
```
ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database. It is designed to make it easy to build 
applications with embeddings. ChromaDB allows you to store embeddings and their metadata, 
and query them efficiently. It is particularly useful for retrieval-augmented generation systems.
```

**document2.txt** (About RAG):
```
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines retrieval of external information with language generation.
RAG systems first retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base, then use those documents
as context for generating responses. This approach reduces hallucinations and allows models
to access up-to-date information.
```

**document3.txt** (About Embeddings):
```
Embeddings are dense vector representations of text. They capture semantic meaning in numerical form.
Similar concepts have similar embedding vectors. The sentence-transformers library provides 
pre-trained models for creating embeddings. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is efficient and effective.
